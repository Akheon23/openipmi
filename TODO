Add sensor SDRs back into the main SDR repository (if they can from
there).

Add controls for the GUIDs (system and device) and for the various
chassis-related commands.

Use GUIDs to tell if an MC has changed.

Improve the granularity of locking.

Modify the LAN connection code to use one socket for all messages,
instead of a socket per connection.  This should make the library
scalable to thousands of domains.
