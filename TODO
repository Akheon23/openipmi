Add a way to be notified if children or parents are added to an
entity.

Add sensor SDRs back into the main SDR repository (if they can from
there).

Add controls for the GUIDs (system and device) and for the various
chassis-related commands.

Use GUIDs to tell if an MC has changed.

Modify the LAN connection code to use one socket for all messages,
instead of a socket per connection.  This should make the library
scalable to thousands of domains.

Add the ability to add/remove connections in domains and IP addresses
for LAN connections.
