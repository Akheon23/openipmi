.TH ipmicmd 8 05/13/03 OpenIPMI "An IPMI Command Interface"

.SH NAME
ipmicmd \- An IPMI Command Interface

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipmicmd
[\-k entry to execute] smi <smi num>

.B ipmicmd
[\-k entry to execute] lan <ip addr> <port> [<ip addr2> <port 2>] 
<auth> <privilege> <username> <password>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ipmicmd
program allows a user to execute direct IPMI commands.  It can work
with direct interface with the OpenIPMI driver or with IPMI LAN
interfaces.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-k entry-to-execute"
Execute a single command an exit.

.TP
.I "smi <num>"
The SMI number to connect to, for systems with more than on system
interface.  Generally, this is '0'.

.TP
.I "IP addr"
The IP address of the LAN interface.

.TP
.I "port"
The UDP port of the LAN interface, general 623.

.TP
.I "ip addr 2"
Some systems support multiple IP connections, this specified the
second address and is optional.  If specified, OpenIPMI will use both
IP addresses and fail over to the working one if one of them fails.

.TP
.I "port 2"
The port for the second IP connection, generally 623.

.TP
.I "auth"
The authorization to use for the connection, either "none",
"straight", "md5", or "md2".

.TP
.I "privilege"
The privilege to use for the connection, either "callback", "user",
"operator", or "admin".  Note that some IPMI operations will fail
without the correct privilege.

.TP
.I "username"
The user name to use for the connection.  If using this anonymous
user, this should be the empty string "".

.TP
.I "password"
The password to use for the connection.


.SH COMMANDS

Once up, you can execute commands in the user interface.  Note that
commands and responses are asynchronous, you issue a command and the
interface returns immediately.  When the response comes back, it will
be dumped on your console.  That's a little strange looking, but IPMI
is ansychronous underneath.  Note that the \-k option is synchronous,
it will wait for the response or a timeout before returning.

.SS 0f <netfn> <lun> <cmd> [data1 [data2 ...]]
Send a command to the BMC you are connected to.

.SS <channel> <IPMB addr> <netfn> <lun> <cmd> [data1 [data2 ...]]
Send a command to a device on the IPMB bus.

.SS <channel> 00 <IPMB addr> <netfn> <lun> <cmd> [data1 [data2 ...]]
Send a broadcast command to a device on the IPMB bus.

.SS help
Display some help.

.SS regcmd <netfn> <cmd>
Register to receive the given command.  If the driver receives an
external command, it will print it out.  This only works with system
interface connections, it will not work on LAN connections.

.SS unregcmd <netfn> <cmd>
Remove a command registration.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
The asychronous nature of the program can be annoying.
