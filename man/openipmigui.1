.SH NAME
openipmigui \- GUI interface to an IPMI system

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openipmigui

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B openipmigui
is a GUI interface using the OpenIPMI library.  It provides a
tree-structured view of the IPMI domains it connected to.

By default
.B openipmigui
starts up with no connections or anything of that nature.  You must
open connection to domains yourself.  However, you may save your
current configuration and the current domains and some GUI settings;
these will be automatically restored at startup.

The main window has a tree on the left and a log window on the right.
The log window captures informational and error logs from OpenIPMI.
Note that events are not reported in the log window, you must open an
SEL window for a domain to view the events.

.SH OPTIONS
None yet

.SH MENU BAR

The main menu bar contains two pull-down menus: File and View.

The File menu contains Exit, Open Domain, and Save Prefs commands.
The Exit command does as described, and it does not prompt to be sure
you want to exit.  The Open Domain command is how you establish a
connection to an IPMI system.  The Save Prefs command will store the
current domains and the configuration of the main GUI window.  These
settings will be restored at startup.  The settings are stored in
~/.openipmigui.startup; this file may be removed to clear all the
settings.

The View menu contains commands to expand and contract the entire
tree.

.SH TREE VIEW

The tree window has a top-level list of all the domains for which
OpenIPMI has connections (or pending connection).  Each domain
exapands into domain-specific information and a list of entities and
Management Controllers (MCs) for that domain.

Right click drives most of the operations in the tree window.  Many
tree elements have pull-down menus driven by a right mouse button
click.  When in doubt, click.

Color is used in the GUI to denote error status, and shading is used
to denote availability.  If a sensor has an error, the tree entry for
that sensor will change colors.  Black means no error, yellow means
warning, red means critical, and blue means non-recoverable.  These
errors propigate up, so the entity containing that sensor will be the
same color as the most critical error for the sensors underneath it.
The same goes for domain, it will be the same color as the most
critical error for the entities underneath it.  This way, if you watch
the domain, you can determine if a system is in trouble with just the
top-level view, and you can drill down to find the problem.

If a tree entry is shaded, it means that the entry has information
identifying it but does not exist.  For instance, a domain with no
connection, an entity that is not present, or an MC that is not
present.

Note that all information visible in the tree is polled.  Only visible
information is polled, so if you expose something via expanding a tree
element or scrolling, it may be a few seconds before the data is
updated.

.SH DOMAINS

The domains contain various high-level information and an aggregation
of all the System Event Logs (SELs) contained within it.  The SEL
Rescan Time and IPMB Rescan Time are settable via right-click; these
values are remembered when saved and restored.  (Note that these
values in the MC-specific entries are not saved and restore, only the
domain level ones).  Right clicking on the domain gives a set of
operations, including the ability to view the SEL.

.SH ENTITIES

The Entities element under the domain element contains a list of the
entities discovered for that domain.  This is only the top-level
entities (ones not contained in other entities); entities contained in
other entities are listed under their parent entity.  This keeps the
clutter down for very complicated systems, like ATCA.

If the entity is hot-swappable, hot-swap activation and deactivation
commands are available via right-click on the entity. If the entity
has FRU information, you can view that via a right-click command, too.

The information under an entity also contains a sensors and controls
list for the entity.

.SH SENSORS

Sensors are available under the entity they belong to.  Sensor
information is beyond the scope of this document, as IPMI sensors are
very complex.  See the IPMI document from OpenIPMI for information
about sensors.

As expected, right-clicking on a sensor gives operations available on
that sensor.

.SH CONTROLS

Controls are available under the entity they belong to.  control
information is beyond the scope of this document, as IPMI controls are
very complex.  See the IPMI document from OpenIPMI for information
about controls.

As expected, right-clicking on a control gives operations available on
that control.


.SH MANAGEMENT CONTROLLERS (MCs)

An MC is the intelligent node in an IPMI system.  It is not generally
required to know about MCs for normal IPMI sensor and control
operations.  You do need access to MCs, though, for system
configuration.

An MC contains a lot of information about itself and its capabilities;
this is generally automatically interpreted by OpenIPMI, but the
information is available for view.  For instance, if an MC contains an
SEL device, OpenIPMI will automatically handle getting events from it,
but you can also view this setting under the MC information.

A number of operations are available under the right-click menu on the
MC; most of these are self-explanatory.  The MC is generally
configured via the Channel Info command under this.

.SH CHANNEL INFO

If you right click on an MC, it will show a Channel Info entry.  This
is used to configure the LAN and channel information for the MC.  If
you select this, it will pull up a list of channels in a tree view.
Note that unlike the main tree, this information is not dynamically
updated; it will not change if the underlying data changes.

To configure individual channels, expand them.  The Info settings are
read only and cannot be changed.  The User Access settings can be
changed by right-clicking on them.  Note that the change is not
immediate, you must use the Save button at the bottom of the window to
save the changes you have made.  Also, there are two versions of the
User Access settings.  One is volatile, and will update the current
settings for the MC, but if the MC restart the non-volatile settings
will be restored.  Setting the non-volatile settings will not cause an
immediate change, but those changes will be restored on the next MC
restart.

Some channels have user information; you can configure these by
selecting that command in the right-click menu of a channel.

LAN channels also have LAN configuration; you can configure these by
selecting that command in the right-click menu of a channel.

.SH USER INFO

IPMI systems with remote access have users that can be used to log
in.  These users are configured by the User Info command in the
channel listing.  Note that some user setting (the name and password)
are global to all channels on the MC.

Due to the IPMI spec and some unfortunate implementation bugs, some
wierd issues exist with this information.  The user has an Enabled
value that tells whether the user is enabled or not.  When initially
displayed, this field shows as a "?" because this field is not
readable. It will displayed as the actual value when it is modified,
but will not be changed otherwise.

There is also a session limit field that gives the maximum number of
sessions a user is allowed to make.  This field is also not readable
and displays as a "?" when first displayed.  This field is marked as
optional in the IPMI spec, which means the field does not have to be
supplied.  Some implementations, however, require this field to be
set.  If you get a DataLenInv error back from your system when setting
something, you must set the field to something for any value to be
set.  Generally, setting it to zero disables the field and is the
right thing to do.

.SH LANPARMS

In the channel display on a 8023_LAN channel, a LANPARM configuration
command is available.  This pulls up all the parameters for the LAN
and allows them to be set.  Right-clicking on an item allows it to be
changed.
