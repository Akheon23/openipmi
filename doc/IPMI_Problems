1) Detection of entity presence is far too complicated.  Specifically,
   the handling of the "FRU device" detection is vague.  Does this
   mean a management controller is present or not present?  Does it
   mean that the mangement software should send a FRU inventory
   message to the FRU device and it gets an error?  If the latter is
   true, then there should be a standard 8xh return code from the FRU
   inventory saying that it is not present.

2) The description of the LAN interface is far too vague.  Most
   systems I have seen send two messages back for one sent.  It
   doesn't say this anywhere.  A simple diagram with exactly how an
   IPMB-bridged (and system-interface bridged for that matter) works
   would make a world of difference.  IMHO, the most efficient and
   effective method would be one send and one response with the full
   response carried in the response.  Getting two messages back from
   the BMC is inefficient and confusing for every piece involved.

3) In a type 1 SDR, byte 21 (Sensor Units 1), the data format of 11b
   means that it does not return a numeric value.  However, this means
   that you cannot interpret all the data field that come later, like
   the minimums and maximums and thresholds.  Does setting the data
   format to 11b mean that these field are not applicable?  How does
   this work?

4) There is no reliable way to detect if the IPMI controller has
   issued an NMI due to a watchdog pretimeout.  You can't send a
   message to the IPMI controller in an NMI handler; you need a
   register that you can directly read to tell you this.  This makes
   using the NMI pretimeout very risky.

5) In type 9 SDRs, in the entity device address fields, it states that
   it is "Set to 00h if Instace ID is device-relative".  This is
   almost certainly a mistake.  It shouldbe system-relative, not
   device-relative.

6) There is no way to read the user session limit (set by the set user
   access command)
