2003-01-21 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>
	* configure.in: Went to version 0.1.1

2003-01-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a list_sel command.

	* ui.c: Modified the clear sel command to go through all the
	events and delete them, instead of clearing the SEL with a
	command.

	* sel.c: Fixed the next, previous, first, last, and get all
	operations to take into account deleted events.  Also fixed a bug
	where re-adding an event that was deleted would cause the count to
	be wrong.

2003-01-17 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added a debug flag to disable
	LAN connections.

2003-01-16 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h:
	Added a mechanism to report failures of the lower-level
	connection, and added code to ignore periodic events (bus scan,
	SEL scan) while the connection is down.
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	
	* OpenIPMI.texi: Documented the changes to the SEL code.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Added an OEM callback for MC
	removal.

	* mc.c: Added detection of when an MC goes away or changes.

	* mc.c: Cleaned up the MC cleanup code to consolidate it.

	* entity.c: Modified entity sensor/control deletion so that if all
	the entities and sensors are gone, and the entity was
	auto-created, that the entity itself would be destroyed.

	* sel.c: Reworked the event deletion code so that it works even
	without the ability to delete individual entries.  If all the
	entries in the local database are deleted, it will clear out the
	database (if the reservation hasn't been lost).

2003-01-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sel.c: Fixed a locking problem with SEL operations.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added a hook for event
	deletion handling, so OEM code can do its own event deletion.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added handling for ignoring
	events (only sending to the unhandled interface) for events that
	were already in the SEL at startup.

2003-01-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a fix for handling local interface BMCs.

2003-01-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move version to 0.1.0.

	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.
	
	* sel.c, mc.c: Minor cleanups.

	* ipmi_smi.c: Modified the timeout to be a much larger value.
	The device drivers have their own timers, we just need to make
	sure something doesn't go wrong here.

2003-01-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Added a periodic rescan of the presence sensors
	periodically (with the bus scan).
	
	* ui.c: Added rescanning of entities when displaying them.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/mc.h, entity.c: Added support for
	handling unhandled (not delivered to the user) events, so the user
	can delete them if they like.

	* ui.c: The info wasn't being passed into the id-to-pointer
	converted for the mccmd command.
	
	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.

	* control.c: Fixed the calculation size for the non-standard entry
	array size.

	handler for the OEM info.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h, sensor.c: ditto

	* entity.c, mc.c: Added an entity-specific lock, and used it where
	entities were specifically being locked.

	* ipmi_sensor.c, sensor.c: Made the sensor callbacks const.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h, mc.c, ui.c: Added an event debug
	level.

2003-01-03 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>
