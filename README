This is the OpenIPMI library, a library that makes simplifies building
complex IPMI systems.

Note that most of the OpenIPMI library was designed for building
complicated systems that continuously monitor IPMI hardware.  It's not
for little things that simply want to get some information, do
something, and leave (unless that information is elaborate
information).

It does include the utility "ipmicmd" which lets you do direct IPMI
commands to a connection.  ipmicmd can connect using the OpenIPMI
driver or via IPMI LAN.

OpenIPMI also includes a LAN to system interface converter, it can sit
on top of an OpenIPMI driver and supply a LAN connection to the BMC.

Note that parts of OpenIPMI could be used inside other systems.
However, the LGPL license may be a restriction.  If you are interested
in re-licensing parts of OpenIPMI, contact MontaVista software.
