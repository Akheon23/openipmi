  1) Why is ipmi_ui so ugly?

     Well, ipmi_ui is a test program that I wrote for my own purposes.
     I'll try to clean it up in the future and make it into something
     useful, and it's certainly ugly, but it's primarily for my
     testing.

     If you want to write something useful to replace it, feel free!


  2) What if I just want to send some IPMI commands.

     Then "ipmicmd" is the tools for you.  It can connect to a system
     interface or to a LAN connection and let you directly enter
     commands.


  3) I'm trying to write a little program that comes up and queries a
     few things.  Can I use the OpenIPMI library to do that?

     Probably not.  OpenIPMI was designed as a large-scale IPMI
     interface for programs that stay up and do lots of management
     work.  It's not really for one-off little tools.

     If you want to do small tools, it's easy enough to just open the
     device and send the commands (or use the ipmicmd tool).  You have
     to understand IPMI well to use it at that level, anyway.


  4) Why can't I just perform an operation and immediately get the
     results?  Why all these callbacks?

     Read the documenation for details.  The OpenHPI interface
     (http://openhpi.sourceforce.net) is expected to sit on top of the
     OpenIPMI library and provide an interface more like that.  Plus,
     you can write your own wrappers to do it.  It's not possible to
     write event-driven wrappers on top of a non-event-driven
     interface.


  5) Can I have multiple OpenIPMI session from different programs to
     the same interface?

     Certainly.  I do it all the time :-)

     The main problem is the System Event Log (SEL).  Somebody has to
     delete items from the SEL.  You have a couple of options...

     If you don't care about the SEL, then set the SEL rescan time to
     zero with ipmi_domain_set_sel_rescan_time().  This will turn off
     the SEL completely.

     If you do care about SELs on multiple programs, you will have to
     develop a protocol between all the users.  You have to have a way
     to let all the listeners get all the SELs, but still delete items
     from the SEL in a timely manner.  I recommend that you set the
     SEL rescan time to a value, and for every event receive wait
     double that value before deleting it.  OpenIPMI will correctly
     handle multiple things deleting items from the SEL.


  6) Can you open more than one IPMI session from OpenIPMI?

     Certainly.  You can create as many connections and domains as you
     like, the library has no limitiation.
